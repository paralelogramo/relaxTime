# Time to Relax

**Time to Relax** is a simple and minimalist web page that displays your local time and, if you grant location permissions, also shows your city, country, and the current temperature in Celsius degrees.

## Features

- Displays the local time in real time.
- If the user grants location permissions, shows the city, country, and current temperature using a weather API.
- **Four weather backgrounds available:** You can switch between four different weather environments (sunset, cloudy, rainy, and shiny).  
- The page background uses **parallax effects** for moving clouds in all four weather types, creating a dynamic and relaxing visual experience.
- **Privacy:** Location information is **never stored or processed** at any time. It is only used temporarily to query the weather API and display the result on screen.
- Personal project, open source, and not for commercial use.
